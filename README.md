# ai-models-graphcast-small

`ai-models-graphcast-small` is an [ai-models](https://github.com/ecmwf-lab/ai-models) plugin to run the small, lower-resolution version (1.0 degree horizontal resolution and 13 pressure levels) of Google Deepmind's [GraphCast](https://github.com/deepmind/graphcast).

GraphCast: Learning skillful medium-range global weather forecasting, arXiv preprint: 2212.12794, 2022. https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12794

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yeechianlow/ai-models-graphcast-small
```

This will install the package and most of its dependencies.

Then to install graphcast dependencies (and Jax on GPU):



### Graphcast and Jax

Graphcast depends on Jax, which needs special installation instructions for your specific hardware.

Please see the [installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) to follow the correct instructions.

We have prepared two `requirements.txt` you can use. A CPU and a GPU version:

For the preferred GPU usage:
```
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

For the slower CPU usage:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
